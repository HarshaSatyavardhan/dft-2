/home2/harsha.vasamsetti/miniconda3/envs/slices/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pymatgen/io/vasp/sets.py:379: BadInputSetWarning: Overriding POTCARs is generally not recommended as it significantly affect the results of calculations and compatibility with other calculations done with the same input set. In many instances, it is better to write a subclass of a desired input set and override the POTCAR in the subclass to be explicit on the differences.
